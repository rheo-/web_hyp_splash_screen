This is a simple splash screen plug-in for websites.

Create a div id hyp_splash_screen, and inside this div create a button or link with id hyp_splash_terminate.
Include the files splash_screen.css and splash_screen.js in the HTML. And also include JQuery.

And you are done. You can add your own elements and style rules inside the splash screens.

Example:

<div id="hyp_splash_screen">
    <button id=hyp_splash_terminate">START</button>
</div>
